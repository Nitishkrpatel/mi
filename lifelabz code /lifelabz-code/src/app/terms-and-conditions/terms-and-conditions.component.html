    <h5><strong>Use of Cookies and Other Web Tracking Technologies</strong></h5>
    <p>A “cookie” is a small piece of data stored on a user’s device. When you visit the Sites, LifeLabz may place “cookies” on your device which allows us to compile information about Sites usage and to recognize you when you visit the Sites again. In addition,
        we use pixel tags “tiny graphic images ” to tell us what parts of our Sites our users have visited, or to measure the effectiveness of searches performed on our Sites. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format that users can
        read and tell us whether emails have been opened to help assure that we’re only sending messages that are of interest to our users. If you subsequently provide us with your personal information, such as your email address, we may associate our
        cookies and tags with that information.</p>
    <p>Like many other companies, we use third-party partners to analyze data you provide to us or data about your browsing behavior that we collect when you visit our Sites. Our Sites may include tracking technology from Google Analytics,&nbsp; and other
        similar technologies. These tools provide us with analytical information, reports, and analysis about the use of our Sites and may record the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the Internet, the type of device and operating
        system you are using, your general geographic information, as well as events that occur within our Site, such as the page that led you to our Sites, how often you visit pages within our Sites, and other data related to the use of our Sites. We
        may also use these tools to create more targeted experiences or marketing messages and to help serve content that is relevant to you. For more information about these services, the related privacy policies and options available to you, please
        visit the websites of our analytics service providers listed above.</p>
    <p>If you wish to avoid LifeLabz’s use of these analytics services on our Sites, you may use any opt-out mechanisms provided by our analytics providers and/or actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to delete or disable cookies
        and other tracking/recording tools. In addition, certain jurisdictions require companies to provide the ability for users to refuse the use of certain types of cookies that are not strictly necessary to the functionality of the site; accordingly,
        we have modified our Sites to enable such users to opt-out of the placement of cookies that are not strictly necessary to the functionality of the Sites.</p>
    <p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Sites. When a user clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help
        us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be tracked this way, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in our email messages</p>
