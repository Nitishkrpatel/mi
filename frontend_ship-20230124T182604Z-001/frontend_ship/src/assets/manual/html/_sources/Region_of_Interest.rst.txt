*******************
Region of Interest
*******************


Ships positions in a predefined Region or area - Region of Interest (ROI) or bounding box* gives you the ability to track all ships activity in an area you have predefined.

A Region or area is bounding box is an area defined in the map by two pairs of coordinates (minimum/maximum longitude and latitude).

In Navika application You can create a region by using the mouse by Click and drag the box.  

First you click on the menu as indicated in the :numref:`ROI-menu-select` to select the Region of Interest. 

co-ordinates in the shape of rectangle or square select the region on the map. 

	- Where ships and vessels trajectories are passed through and anchored in the region. In this region where irrespective of the ship types are populated. 

	- The current location and track information of the ships operating within a Region of Interest or bounding box you have specified, this information can then be used to create a detailed database of 			movements for analysis.

	- You have set a timeline and Monitor ships activity. 

	- Ship Positions in a ROI area gives you the ability to track all ships activity in a ROI, will be saved under your Navika account.

	- You have the option to receive Last known positional information with a refresh rate of interval. 

	- Using this Region of Interest to keep up-to-date with the current location and trajectories information of the ship operating within a Region of Interest


 :term:`Click here for more information on ROI <ROI>`

The following steps to create the Region of Interest:

 #. Click on the left menu bar to select Region of Interest
 #. Click on the Mark area on the Map button for mark the area
 #. Region can part of the land mass is also permitted 
 #. You can click and release the left mouse key after selecting the required area
 #. Once you select the area, pop-up box will indicate the 4 latitude and longitude of 4 vertices of the selected area
 #. You can type in  name of the region of your choice
 #. Click on the Add button, Region will created
 #. The region selected is independent of date and time
 #. You have logged in current date and time.
 #. Region added to the menu bar

Now you can add new region of you choice, to learn follow the steps as indicated in the :numref:`ROI-Region-add-new`

 .. _ROI-Region-add-new:

     Add New Region
     
In the :numref:`ROI-Region-add-new-name-the-Region` indicate to Enter the Region Name of your choice. but Empty field is not accepted. Aslo you can observe that panel to enter Region name has 4 points in LAT/LONG values for the 4 vertices of the bounding box, that is the Region we have selected. This are stored in your profile, even if you logged out of the Navika application. So that you can log-in later time. 

So for clarity, as indicated in the :numref:`ROI-Region-add-new-name-the-Region-test2` we are entering the name as **test2** for the region we have defined.

     Add new name for the Region-test2
     
In the :numref:`ROI-Region-test2-added-process-20-40mins` indicate the confirmation message that Region is added, and Statistical and Timeline info computation is under process, it may take 20 to 40 minutes and you have click OK button. Since it will depends on the Time Series you have selected.

Once the you have clicked OK, the newly added Region name will be listed in the menu with check Box. As indicated in the :numref:`ROI-Region-test2-added-Listed-ROI`, also you can observe that the navigational bar has Adjusted Date and time with Paused clock, and as per the plot clock, ships/vessles are plotted. So this is not impacted with process computation with respect to Region of Interest.

Ther is no limit for adding the new region into your account.

In the following figure :numref:`ROI-menu-open-with-Test1-Region` already Region - test1 is added. So you can able to understand the functionality of Region of Interest. 


In the :numref:`ROI-menu-open-with-Test1-Region` after you have added the Region, you can click on the check box for anaysis of the Region. that is statistical with Timeline Info in which you can set the timeline by sliding the Year of your requirement.

As you have opened the Region of Interest, without checking the Selected Region Box, Statistical & Timeline info are displayed and In the Navigation Bar all the fields are active until you check the box in the Selected region. 

Once you have checked the box, Plot clock, Adjusted date and Time, Reset clock / sync clock to server button are hidden. except Search Field.

Further to the above, the Statistical Info panel is indicated in the :numref:`ROI-menu-open-with-Test1-Region-Statistical&Timeline-info`  with the following 

In Navika application, you can find 26 categories of vessels.

 - Vessel Category:

#. Passenger
#. Pleasure
#. Unknown
#. Equipment
#. Dredging
#. HSC
#. Law Enforcement
#. Medical

In the :numref:`ROI-menu-open-with-Test1-Region-Statistical&Timeline-info` with list of vessel type. Based on this, Region is computed with data available.

     Region's Statistical & Timeline info
 
 #. Click on check box to select the region for Statistical & Timeline info 
 #. After you selected the Region in the menu bar, the Region is displayed with border enclosed.
 #. Region statistical & Timeline info panel is displayed 
 #. Based on the timeline you have selected and if you have not checked any of the ship type, 
    all the categories are selected, else which is selected by is highlighted and the statistical graph will be plotted.
 #. You  can select all or any 26 category of ships / vessels.

sub-types are not listed in this documentation.


If you do not select any ship or ships in the panel, by  default it will be selected all the categories of ships. Graphically displayed all the available data for each category.

In the :numref:`ROI-menu-open-with-Test1-Region-plotting-ontime-series`, you can set the year range, as indicated in the Slider. In the figure indicated the region you selected. Click OK on the pop-up to continue to process the data based on the slider we have set to 2018 to 2021 by using the slider. You can observe the Region selected has the option and features available in Global Search, Mouse hover over the Ship Icon to display the Tool tips which has the basic ship details with DTG. Even you left click over the ship icon the pop-up menu will be displayed. So the details of the particular ship/vessel are diplayed.

Also be noted that you can click one at a time, multiple selection of the ship is not implemented in this application

Later in the section will show you how to set the Time series.

In the :numref:`ROI-Region-select-Region-display-indication` indicates once you checked the box - Region it defined earlier, Yellow rectangular box appear. In the Navigation Bar Adjusted clock and Plot clock and other features are hidden except Search Function. Even Search Function is active in the Region of Interest.

In the :numref:`ROI-Region-display-indication-ship-populated` indicated with ships/vessels are plotted within the region - test1 in this case. Also you can observe that all the feature like click to see the ships details and predicated type and you can add to Individual Ships that is Ships of Interest(SOI) and to Ship Group. Search funtion is also active.

Ship icon, color, and shape are displayed on the Live Map is dependant on the vessel's type and status.
